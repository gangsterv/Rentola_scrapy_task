# Rentola_scrapy_task
Scrapy Challenge for Rentola applying process
____
My submission for Rentola's Scrapy task. We extract the title and the url from the "h4-space" div, and the price from the "bottom-ic" div (h5 tag)

The property class didn't include a url field, which made an error occur, according to the example provided. I added the url field so that it can also be scrapped
